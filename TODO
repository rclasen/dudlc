lib: enum item names are not prefixed

lib: add documentation (doxygen?)

*: convert events, errors, signals, ... to glib-2.0

error handling in lib and cmd is horrible

cli: print error messages to stderr

cli: keep trying to reconnect

cmd: make queue-idlist aware of min/max queue IDs

cli: remove queuealbum command

implement all lib commands

implement all cli commands

GTK client
 + gtkdudlc.1 manpage
 + commandline options
 + pick search result for queue/tagging/...
 + "visual" "drag/drop" queue manipulation
 + single-key actions for play/pause/stop/next
 - tagging
 - filter manipulation (sfilter*/filterset)

new ncurses client (extra window for current track/status)
 - conflicts with readline

method to find command mismatches: db-backend, server, lib, cmd

cli: find way to feed search results to other commands
 - tracksearch -> queueadd
 - queuesearch -> queuedel
 - ...
 - maybe maintain a hidden idlist, that's updated for each command.
