error handling in lib and cmd is horrible

print error messages to stderr

cli: readline handling is clumsy

cmd: uses hardcoded terminal control codes for bold output

cli: put bcast in current line, opening a new one

implement all lib commands

implement all cli commands

cache layer for artists, albums, tags, user

GTK client

ncurses client (extra window for current track/status)

method to find command mismatches server, lib, cmd
