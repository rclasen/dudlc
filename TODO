error handling in lib and cmd is horrible

print error messages to stderr

cli: readline handling is clumsy

cmd: uses hardcoded terminal control codes for bold output

cli: put nexttrack bcast in current line, opening a new one

lib: make all functions accept lists of track/artist/whatever IDs

cli: parse lists and ranges of tracks/artist/whatever

implement all lib commands

implement all cli commands

cache layer for artists, albums, tags, user

make completion list generation more modular:
 - only return what shall be completed
 - provide a way to get a list of completions for this
