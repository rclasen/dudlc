lib: enum item names are not prefixed

convert events, errors, signals, ... to glib-2.0

error handling in lib and cmd is horrible

print error messages to stderr

cli: keep trying to reconnect

cli: readline handling is clumsy

cmd: uses hardcoded terminal control codes for bold output

cli: put bcast in current line, opening a new one

cmd: make queue-idlist aware of min/max queue IDs

remove queuealbum

implement all lib commands

implement all cli commands

GTK client
 + gtkdudlc.1 manpage
 + commandline options
 + config file
 + visual progress indication
 + jump on click
 + pick search result for queue/tagging/...
 + "visual" "drag/drop" queue manipulation
 + single-key actions for play/pause/stop/next
 + cli-like command-window
 - tagging
 - filter manipulation (sfilter*/filterset)

ncurses client (extra window for current track/status)
 - conflicts with readline

method to find command mismatches: db-backend, server, lib, cmd

find way to feed search results to other commands
 - tracksearch -> queueadd
 - queuesearch -> queuedel
 - ...
 - maybe maintain a hidden idlist, that's updated for each command.
